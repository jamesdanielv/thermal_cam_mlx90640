# thermal_cam_mlx90640
same as thermal cam project but with mlx90640 sensor
these sensors work differently and have different resolution, so process is different in many areas
one of the things that is different is paging of data and built in ram locations.
i have here an example that reads the first bank of 16 sensors.
at start up it calibrates to heat levels, and then anything above the heat level at start up registers on the terminal.

example showing it is is here:
